## Installation

```
npm i @react-pdf/renderer react-pdf-builder 
```

> Note: This project has a dependency on [@react-pdf/renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-pdf/renderer). Make sure it's installed along with `react-pdf-builder`.

## Quick Start

Below is a component that renders a standard [A4 size](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-page-sizes--docs) PDF with a heading, paragraph, button, and custom styled div. You can use this as a starting point.

Most components can be [themed](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs) using the `swatch` prop, and custom styled with CSS using `style` or [`className`](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs#class-names).

Use `LETTER` page size for 8.5x11" paper used in the USA.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Fonts, Themes, ThemedPage, Div, Button, Box, PDFThemeProvider, Heading3, Paragraph } from 'react-pdf-builder'
import { Document, PDFViewer } from '@react-pdf/renderer';

export const QuickStart = () => {
  const roboto = Fonts.load(Fonts.sansSerif.roboto);
  Font.register(roboto);
  Font.registerEmojiSource(Fonts.emojis.joyPixels());
  const theme = Themes.default.build({
    scale: 1,
    override: {
      classNames: { 'my-custom-class': { color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'darkblue', padding: 10 } },
    },
  });
  return (
    <PDFViewer style={{ height: 700, width: 500 }}>
      <Document>
        <PDFThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <ThemedPage size="A4" style={{ fontFamily: roboto.family }}>
            <Box dir="y" className="gap-3">
              <Heading3 rule>Hello, world!</Heading3>
              <Paragraph className="mb-0">Let's get started building the PDF.</Paragraph>
              <Box>
                <Button href="#">Button</Button>
              </Box>
              <Div className="my-custom-class w-50">50% Div with a custom class. üëç</Div>
            </Box>
          </ThemedPage>
        </PDFThemeProvider>
      </Document>
    </PDFViewer>
  );
};
```

This will create the following PDF:

## Why use React PDF Builder?

While the underlying project, [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/), gives you everything you need to build a beautiful PDF... you will need to build it completely from scratch.

There are no headings, no tables, no buttons, no lists. 

Instead, you'll have to define styles for every single element in your PDF. This can be a huge hassle when all you want is to build your PDF!

Enter React PDF Builder.

This framework provides a set of [30+ pre-made components](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-components-overview--docs) (based on [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)) that can help you bring your PDF to life quickly and easily.

The framework also gives you the ability to define [class names](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs#class-names) to style your PDF components.

In addition, there's drop in support for 25 [fonts](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-fonts--docs) with bold and italics, and 5 different sets of [emojis](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-fonts--docs#adding-emoji-support). 

All ready to go, so you can start building immediately.

## How to use React PDF Builder

Follow the quick start above to get up and running quickly. 

Then check out the [components overview](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-components-overview--docs) for the components you have at your disposal. Each component page has a live example at the bottom.

You may also want to familiarize yourself with [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/), the library this framework is built upon, for the basics.

## Components overview

You can see all the [available components here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-components-overview--docs).

## Themes

React PDF Builder includes a robust theme system that allows you to quickly and easily style the components in the framework. 

The framework includes both a light and dark theme based on [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Most components support a `swatch` prop that lets you quickly style the component's colors using the theme's color scheme. For instance, to swatch a [Table](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-components-tables-table--docs) to blue, give it the `"blue"` swatch. You can see all [swatch colors here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs#swatch-colors).

Want to tweak a theme's appearance? You can [override](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs#override-existing-themes) and define your own custom colors, borders, class names, spacing‚Äîyou name it.

You can [read more about themes here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-themes--docs).

## Utility class names

The framework includes a large catalog of utility classes to make styling your PDF components easy (and concise). Utility classes are adapted from [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/), so you may already be familiar with them.

You can [see all utility classes here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-utility-classes--docs).

## Fonts and formatting

React PDF Builder includes [25 drop-in fonts](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-fonts--docs), ready to use, and supporting the Latin charset (English) with bold and italic formatting. 

All built-in fonts are hosted via [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), but you can [self-host](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-fonts--docs#self-hosting-built-in-fonts) them too if you'd like.

The framework also includes drop-in support for 5 different Emoji sets by JoyPixels, Noto Emoji, OpenMoji, and Twemoji. Read more about [emoji support here](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-fonts--docs#adding-emoji-support).

## Downloading PDFs

If you'd like to make your PDF Document downloadable via a link, you can use the [PDFDownloadLink from react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/components#pdfdownloadlink).
