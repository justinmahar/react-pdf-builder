## Page size reference

For easy reference, [pages](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-pdf-builder/?path=/docs/documentation-components-basics-themedpage--docs) can be sized using the `size` prop and one of the following strings.

The standard printable letter size is `"LETTER"` in the U.S. and `"A4"` elsewhere.

All sizes are measured in points at 72 dpi.

| String        | Width     | Height    | Notes                                                                                   |

Here's a table explaining each series:

| Series         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A Series**   | The A series is a set of ISO paper sizes used internationally. The sizes are based on dividing a sheet of paper in half, maintaining the same aspect ratio. A0 is the largest, and sizes progressively decrease (A1, A2, etc.), with A4 being the most commonly used size for letters and documents. |
| **B Series**   | The B series provides larger sizes that are intermediate between A sizes. They are used for posters, print media, and other applications where a larger format is desirable. B series sizes are denoted with a "B" and also follow a geometric progression similar to the A series.                  |
| **C Series**   | The C series is designed mainly for envelopes and packaging that will fit A and B sizes. C sizes are larger than the corresponding A sizes to accommodate documents without folding. C4 envelopes, for example, are suitable for A4 documents.                                                       |
| **RA Series**  | The RA series is a variation of the A series that includes extra space for bleed margins on printed materials. This series is typically used for designs that require print to the edge of the paper, ensuring that any cutting issues do not affect the final design.                               |
| **SRA Series** | The SRA series is similar to the RA series, offering oversized paper for printing with bleed. SRA sizes are standardized slightly larger than A sizes, providing additional margin for printing and trimming, making it favorable for large print jobs like brochures and magazines.                 |
| **ID Series**  | ID sizes (such as ID1) are specialized formats primarily used for identification cards and various small documents. These sizes must fit standard materials like credit cards or IDs for identification purposes.                                                                                    |

## Scaling components to fit pages

You can scale all of your components by passing the `scale` option to the theme builder.

```ts
const theme = Themes.default.build({
  scale: 1, // <- Change the scale here
});
```

By default, a scale of `1` is sized for `A4` or `LETTER` pages at 72 dpi, with a font size of 16 pts.

A scale of `2` would be sized to fit an `A2` (which is 2x the size of `A4`), a scale of `4` would be sized for an `A0` (which is 2x the size of `A2`).

You can easily scale your entire PDF to match any page size by changing this one config value. 

Be sure to multiply any custom style sizes by the scale factor as well.
